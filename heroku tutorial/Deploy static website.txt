Heroku Tutorials 

Hosting a static website

* first of all I want to tell you that heroku only hosts apps built on above mentioned programming language, not static websites. Here in this tutorial I will show you the trick that will make heroku understand that your static website is a PHP app just by using a single php file to do the trick. 

* Install heroku and git for your operating system

* First of all create a repository 
* Do git add and git commit on it 
* push the code online using github and git remote add origin http://njnsdf.nds and git push -u origin master

* After that login to heroku from local system
* heroku login

* To make heroku know that our code is php we have to make a composer file
* touch Composer.json

* Then open the composer.json and type {} and save it

* The make a index.php file
* touch index.php

* Then open the index.php in text editor and make a redirect call to index.html file

Code :- 

<?php
header('Location: index.html');
?>

* Then use git add . and git commit to commit all the changes
* Push the code online using git remote add origin and git push

* Create a heroku app using 
* heroku create “your app name without quotes”
 
* Then push the code to the repository of heroku
* git push heroku master

* Then make the server running 
* heroku ps:scale web=1

* We can open the website using 
* heroku open
